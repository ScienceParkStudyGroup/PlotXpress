# PlotXpress
 
PlotXpress is a shiny app that simplifies the analysis and plotting of data from a dual luciferase experiment in 96-well format.

## Input data (expressed as arbitrary luminescence units)
* Excel sheet containing 2 tables in 96-well lay-out (raw output from a Promega GloMaxÂ® Navigator). An unprocessed example output file is included: DualLuc_example_data.xlsx
* An excel file or CSV file in which conditions are indicated in a 96-well lay-out. The conditions are seperated by underscores (see the example design that is included in this repo: Design_example.xlsx)

### Example output

Standard output generated with the example data:
